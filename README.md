## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Import the sys module.

### Step 2: 
Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script. Open the file as sys.argv[1]
 
### Step 3: 
Read the file using read() method.

### Step 4: 
Use split() method to split the file content into words.

### Step 5: 
Use len() to find the total words.

### Step 6: 
Run the program to determine the number of words in the file created.
